Buildmetadata:
- Does not create folder through "file" argument.
- Assumes variate can only be positive when it is not, unsure if this is wise
- Should we ask users to check if ordinal variates are actually categorical?
- Documentation is not clear on nominal variates
- Buildmetadata thought I had an ordinal variate instead of nominal so it dit not create the nominal columns, very confusing to edit manually
- If I know the approximate bounds of a variate, should I use those?
- In the documentation it looks like I should put NA in fields
- Need an empty line to end csv file

learn:
- Add a check that the metadata has an appropriate shape
Do I have to assign learn to a variable?
